          My first book was The Power of Subconscious Mind by Joseph Murphy in
          2024. This book marked the beginning of my journey into the world of
          reading, and it completely transformed the way I think about
          self-improvement and success. The insights about the mind's potential
          to shape reality fascinated me, and I realized how powerful our
          thoughts can be in driving positive change.

          Exploring Entrepreneurship with Zero to One
        </h2>
        <p className="text-neutral-400 leading-loose text-justify  text-[13px]  tracking-wide">
          After that, I picked up Zero to One by Peter Thiel. This book shifted
          my focus to entrepreneurship and innovation. Thiel's perspective on
          building groundbreaking startups emphasized the importance of creating
          something entirely new rather than simply improving existing ideas. It
          challenged me to think bigger and inspired me to approach my own
          projects with a more creative mindset.

          Learning Resilience from The Hard Thing About Hard Things
        </h2>
        <p className="text-neutral-400 leading-loose text-justify  text-[13px]  tracking-wide">
          Currently, I’m reading The Hard Thing About Hard Things by Ben
          Horowitz. This book dives deep into the tough realities of building
          and managing a business. Unlike traditional leadership books, Horowitz
          openly discusses the difficulties founders face, from making tough
          decisions to handling unexpected challenges. It’s teaching me that
          embracing discomfort and uncertainty is often the key to long-term
          success.

          Embracing the Power of Reading
        </h2>
        <p className="text-neutral-400 leading-loose text-justify  text-[13px]  tracking-wide mb-2">
          Through these books, I’ve developed a deeper appreciation for the
          power of ideas, the strength of resilience, and the importance of
          continuous learning. Each book has offered valuable lessons that I’ve
          applied in my projects and personal growth. The habit of reading has
          not only expanded my knowledge but also equipped me with the mindset
          to face challenges with confidence and creativity.
        </p>
        <p className="text-neutral-400 leading-loose text-justify  text-[13px]  tracking-wide">
          I believe that reading is more than just a pastime; it’s a tool for
          unlocking potential and discovering new perspectives. As I continue to
          explore new books, I’m excited to see how they shape my journey ahead.
